    <div class="about">
        <p>I am a web developer and a current Thinkful student.
            The real <span>passion</span> for programming comes from the idea that you
            can make an idea come to life. I can build any type of application or
            platform I want. To me, this is a form of <span>freedom</span>.
    
            Traveling is on my radar. I want to meet different
            people and become aware of different cultures. From a <span>teamwork</span> perspective,
            there are multiple minds working to figure out an issue. I also
            enjoy the <span>ability</span> to bounce ideas off of other people. &nbsp;</p>
